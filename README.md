1. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application?
A website shows information for people to read or view, like a school or news site. A web application, on the other hand, lets users interact and do tasks online, such as Google Docs or Facebook.

2. Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites?
Organizations need websites to share information, promote their services, and connect with people or customers easily.

3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?
It was difficult at first, especially with no prior knowledge of using Git or GitHub. But learning it was a great experience because it helped me develop new technical skills.

4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?
Writing a README can help explain the purpose and process of a project clearly. It can also make future work easier and open up opportunities to learn more about programming and project organization.
